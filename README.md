# wasd-iso-104-fr

This project hold the custom layout I designed for a WASD Keyboard featuring an AZERTY fr-FR disposition.
This project also contains a [compliant disposition for the AFNOR AZERTY NF Z71-300 layout](https://github.com/springcomp/wasd-iso-104-fr/blob/nf-z71-300/wasd-inkscape-104.88-iso.fr%20(nf%20z71-300).svg).

While WASD offers an AZERTY keyboard, mine differs in that text on the keys have been translated to french.

Starting from the Modern/Symbols/Windows 8 selection on the customization dialog,
the included layout contains the original template from WASD with the following additionnal changes:
 
 - 'Esc' has been translated to 'Échap'.
 - 'Insert' has been translated to 'Insér.' and
 - 'Del' has been translated to 'Suppr.'.
 - Slightly modified 'Home' key.
 - Additionnal arrows and navigation keys on the numeric keypad.
 - Text on the 'Alt Gr' key and for all characters that can be input using 'Alt Gr' use a slightly different shade of gray (for instance, see the contrast between the 'à' and the '@').

The file includes a 'Color' layer that makes it easier to see the final result.
However, those colors are easily achievable from the customization dialog.
